I am not a tax lawyer or accountant and this is not intended as legal or tax advice. There most likely **_are bugs_** in this software. So please consult a tax advisor if you want the assurance of 100% accuracy on your taxes. This tool is intended only to help you filling out your 1040ES without having to do all of the annoying manual (and unintuitive) calculations.
